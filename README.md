### About Data Files
All the data files are stored in a folder named `data_files` of this repo. Here is a list of data files it should've contained:

- `Baoan_Weather_1998_2022.csv`
- `earthquakes-2022-10-29_09-50-02_+0800.csv`
- `ibtracs.ALL.list.v04r00.csv`
- `Jinzhou_Precipitation.csv`
- `Jinzhou_Weather_1956_2022.csv`

Due to the Github's limitation of file size, I'm not able to push files larger than 100MB, so the `ibtracs.ALL.list.v04r00.csv` is missing.
However, it can be downloaded from [this website](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-best-track-archive?name=ibtracs-data).

De-seasonalized can be interpreted as "de-seasonalized Sept. = THAT Sept. - All Sept. mean" (-2p)

Same as described above. Be careful about the definition of "monthly climatology", which is similar to "de-seasonalize".
